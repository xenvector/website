With the rise of private data sets within organizations, it becomes essential to establish clear relationships between various datasets using LLMs and Knowledge Graphs</p> <p> </p>LLMs vs Knowledge Graphs <p> A prime example that highlights this need would be an incident management platform requiring a thorough understanding of error events and performance events to make accurate service circuit SLA decisions. Likewise, in enterprise security information and event management (SIEM) systems, correlating user identities with their access paths from logs is essential to identify anomalies effectively. The significance of using LLMs for these purposes has gained momentum through discussions within the research community. One such platform that embodies this approach is Microsoft's GraphRAG (Graph-based RAGnometries), which was announced in February 2024. GraphRAG offers an AI-driven content interpretation and search capability by utilizing LLMs to create a knowledge graph from private datasets, enabling users to query the data effectively for better results.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/07/02/graphrag/#graphrag-advantages","title":"GraphRAG Advantages","text":"<p>The major advantage of using Microsoft's GraphRAG over traditional vector search techniques is its ability to handle complex queries that demand higher order reasoning or extensive comprehension of the dataset at hand. For instance, when asked \"What are the most unusual conversations?\" a conventional vector search may fall short if it doesn't find an exact match in the data set. In contrast, GraphRAG builds a knowledge graph based on semantic concepts and provides a holistic understanding of all sources, allowing users to discover relevant information at various levels of abstraction for more accurate retrieval-augmented generation tasks.</p> <p></p> <p>Google Cloud has similar GraphRAG implementation using Neo4J </p> <p>GraphRAG can be employed across critical information discovery and analysis use cases where datasets span multiple documents or contain noise, mixed with misinformation, or when the user's queries are abstract or thematic in nature. Furthermore, it is designed to complement a domain expert's analytical approach rather than replace their insights altogether.</p> <p>The GraphRAG process begins by indexing an input corpus into analyzable TextUnits and extracting entities, relationships, and key claims using LLMs. This information undergoes hierarchical clustering via the Leiden technique to create a visual graph representation of entities. From there, summaries are generated for each community and its constituents from bottom-up, enabling users to gain comprehensive insights into their dataset.</p> <p>When querying GraphRAG's knowledge graph, users can employ two primary modes: global search for holistic questions about the corpus or local search for specific entities by exploring related concepts within their neighborhood. It is worth noting that fine-tuning prompts using Microsoft's Prompt Tuning Guide may be necessary to achieve optimal results when working with your data set.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/07/02/graphrag/#architecture","title":"Architecture","text":"Architecture diagram shows how Google Cloud and Neo4j work together to build and interact with knowledge graphs <ul> <li> <p>Knowledge extraction - On the left side of the diagram, blue arrows show data flowing from structured and unstructured sources into Vertex AI. Generative AI is used to extract entities and relationships from that data which are then converted to Neo4j Cypher queries that are run against the Neo4j database to populate the knowledge graph. This work was traditionally done manually with handcrafted rules. Using generative AI eliminates much of the manual work of data cleansing and consolidation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Knowledge consumption - On the right side of the diagram, green arrows show applications that consume the knowledge graph. They present natural language interfaces to users. Vertex AI generative AI converts that natural language to Neo4j Cypher that is run against the Neo4j database. This allows non technical users to interact more closely with the database than was possible without generative AI</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/2024/07/02/graphrag/#usecases","title":"UseCases","text":"<p>We\u2019re seeing this architecture come up again and again across verticals.

This innovative framework represents an important step forward for AI-assisted vulnerability research, allowing security experts and practitioners to streamline their workflow and focus on the most critical aspects of their work\u2014and maybe even take a well-deserved nap or two!</p> <p> </p>Google Naptime Architecture  <p>Since mid 2023 Google Researcher has been working on a framework for LLM assisted vulnerability research embodying these principles, with a particular focus on automating variant analysis. This project has been called \"Naptime\" because of the potential for allowing us to take regular naps while it helps us out with our jobs. Please don't tell our manager.</p> <p>Naptime uses a specialised architecture to enhance an LLM's ability to perform vulnerability research. A key element of this architecture is grounding through tool use, equipping the LLM with task-specific tools to improve its capabilities and ensure verifiable results. This approach allows for automatic verification of the agent's output, a critical feature considering the autonomous nature of the system.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/07/06/naptime/#naptime-architecture","title":"Naptime architecture.","text":"<p>The Naptime architecture is centred around the interaction between an AI agent and a target codebase. The agent is provided with a set of specialised tools designed to mimic the workflow of a human security researcher.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Code Browser tool enables the agent to navigate through the target codebase, much like how engineers use Chromium Code Search. It provides functions to view the source code of a specific entity (function, variable, etc.) and to identify locations where a function or entity is referenced. While this capability is excessive for simple benchmark tasks, it is designed to handle large, real-world codebases, facilitating exploration of semantically significant code segments in a manner that mirrors human processes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Python tool enables the agent to run Python scripts in a sandboxed environment for intermediate calculations and to generate precise and complex inputs to the target program.</p> </li> <li> <p>Debugger tool grants the agent the ability to interact with the program and observe its behaviour under different inputs. It supports setting breakpoints and evaluating expressions at those breakpoints, enabling dynamic analysis. This interaction helps refine the AI's understanding of the program based on runtime observations. To ensure consistent reproduction and easier detection of memory corruption issues, the program is compiled with AddressSanitizer, and the debugger captures various signals indicating security-related crashes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reporter tool provides a structured mechanism for the agent to communicate its progress. The agent can signal a successful completion of the task, triggering a request to the Controller to verify if the success condition (typically a program crash) is met. It also allows the agent to abort the task when unable to make further progress, preventing stagnation.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The system is model-agnostic and backend-agnostic, providing a self-contained vulnerability research environment. This environment is not limited to use by AI agents; human researchers can also leverage it, for example, to generate successful trajectories for model fine-tuning.</p> <p>Google's Naptime enables an LLM to perform vulnerability research that closely mimics the iterative, hypothesis-driven approach of human security experts. This architecture not only enhances the agent's ability to identify and analyse vulnerabilities but also ensures that the results are accurate and reproducible.</p>"},{"location":"capability/aiops/","title":"AIOPS Deck.","text":""},{"location":"capability/aiops/#aiops-deck","title":"AIOPS Deck.","text":""},{"location":"capability/appmodern/","title":"App Modernization Deck.","text":""},{"location":"capability/appmodern/#app-modernization-deck","title":"App Modernization Deck.","text":""},{"location":"capability/brochure/","title":"Full Capability Deck.","text":""},{"location":"capability/brochure/#full-capability-deck","title":"Full Capability Deck.","text":""},{"location":"capability/datamesh/","title":"DataMesh Deck.","text":""},{"location":"capability/datamesh/#datamesh-deck","title":"DataMesh Deck.","text":""},{"location":"capability/security/","title":"Security Services Deck.","text":""},{"location":"capability/security/#security-services-deck","title":"Security Services Deck.","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/genai/","title":"GENAI","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/security/","title":"Security","text":""}]}
